            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <h3>To complete the web development course</h3>
            <p class="gray-color">I already have learned basic things like Html, CSS and also got to know the uses of git and GitHub. Git & GitHub, both are not the same. Thankfully I have created a new repository in GitHub so that I can push my code there and also for this now I'm able to host the website here in GitHub.
